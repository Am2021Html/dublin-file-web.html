Back to I am Looking for a Home
Choice Based Lettings is one method of housing allocation that we use.

		   What is Choice Based Lettings?
At present, when vacancies arise, the allocations process can sometimes be very lengthy. Under this scheme, vacancies that come about are advertised in the media and people can register their interest in them. It is hoped that this will lead to a quicker turnaround in vacant properties.

There will be a closing date before which applicants must register their interest.

If a number of applicants express an interest in a property, the final offer will be made to the applicant with the highest list position for that particular type of property (longest on list, highest points and most suitable family size).

All offers of accommodation will be subject to the usual estate management checks.

Contact your local area office for more information on this scheme.

The following properties will be allocated using the Choice Based Letting Scheme: <a href="https://www.dublincity.ie/residential/housing/i-am-looking-home/choice-based-lettings"> Road More! </a> and <a href="https://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/2022-03/5-finglaswood-road.docx"> Download file (.docx) </a>

	     Amy-Joyce Hastings (born 24 September 1980[1]) is an Irish actress who has worked in film, television and theatre. Hastings' first role was in the 1990 film Fools of Fortune.[2] She has also featured in Season 1 of The Tudors alongside Henry Cavill. She has appeared in a number of independent films such as Brit flick Little Deaths (which premiered at Film4 Frightfest and the SXSW festival in the US)[3] and in the lead role of Kate Loughlin in Romantic Comedy The Callback Queen[4] which received a US run at George R. R. Martin's Jean Cocteau Cinema in February 2014[5] and was nominated for two IFTA awards in 2016 following its domestic cinema release. She played Iseult in Len Collin's film Sanctuary, which scored a 100% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website from critics[6] and was proclaimed the Best Irish Feature Film of 2017 by the Dublin Film Critics' Circle.[7] She will next be seen in The Green Sea, starring Katharine Isabelle and directed by Randal Plunkett.[8] She has also starred in a number of award winning short films, and received the 2017 Underground Cinema Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Oonagh in the IFTA Nominated LGBT drama Lily.[9]
		 Childhood and early career
Amy-Joyce Hastings was born in Ireland to parents Robert and Catríona Hastings.[10] Taking a very early interest in acting she enrolled in drama classes at the Gaiety School of Acting when it opened in Dublin in the late 1980s. Here she was scouted by Bond movies casting director Debbie McWilliams and eventually cast in the role of Geraldine Quinton in Fools of Fortune opposite Julie Christie, Iain Glen and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.

A couple of years later, following two final rounds of casting at London's Pinewood Studios she narrowly lost out on the role of Mary Lennox in Warner Bros' The Secret Garden, directed by Agnieszka Holland. Continuing dance and acting classes throughout her younger years, she appeared in a variety of productions and made regular appearances on RTÉ youth interest television programs such as Jo Maxi and Pajo's Junxbox, as well as reviewing children's films for the Pat Kenny radio show.

In 1998 she was shortlisted for the title role in a film – adapted from another William Trevor novel – Felicia's Journey, directed by Atom Egoyan. However she elected instead to train for three years at the Samuel Beckett Centre in Trinity College, Dublin – Ireland's first and only acting degree course. She graduated with a distinction in 2001, and began a full-time acting career.
